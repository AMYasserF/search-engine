In a modern context, today has become known more as a celebration of the labor movement than of nature, as International Workers’ Day, founded in 1889, carries the mantle of May Day.

Economic data this week is stirring talk of stagflation—a mix of slow (and at times recessionary) growth and higher-than-normal inflation. The U.S. economy contracted slightly last quarter, while inflation remains elevated—and possible new tariffs could push prices even higher. A private payroll report from payroll provider ADP showed a slowdown in hiring, raising concerns about the job market. Considering the Federal Reserve’s “dual mandate” of price stability and maximizing employment, the central bank could find itself between a rock and a hard place regarding interest rate policy. Friday’s official unemployment report may play a key role in what happens next. Pluto’s name On May 1, 1930, the dwarf planet Pluto, discovered earlier that year, was officially given its name—by an 11-year-old. Falconer Madan, who had been the head of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, read the news of Pluto’s discovery at breakfast to his granddaughter Venetia Burney, a fan of mythology. Venetia (pictured below) suggested the name Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld. Madan loved it, contacted his astronomer friend Herbert Hall Turner, who contacted Lowell University, which had the naming rights, and the rest is history.
