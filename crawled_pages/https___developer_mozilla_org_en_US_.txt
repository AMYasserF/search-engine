Let's take a look at Temporal, what problems it solves, the current state, and what you'll find in the new documentation about it on MDN. CSS CSS anchor positioning The CSS anchor positioning module defines features that allow you to tether elements together. Certain elements are defined as anchor elements; anchor-positioned elements can then have their size and position set based on the size and location of the anchor elements to which they are bound. Web APIs Using the View Transition API This article explains the theory behind how the View Transition API works, how to create view transitions and customize the transition animations, and how to manipulate active view transitions. This covers view transitions for both DOM state updates in a single-page app (SPA), and navigating between documents in a multi-page app (MPA). JavaScript Temporal The Temporal object enables date and time management in various scenarios, including built-in time zone and calendar representation, wall-clock time conversions, arithmetics, formatting, and more. It is designed as a full replacement for the Date object.
